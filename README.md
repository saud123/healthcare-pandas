# 7-Day Python & Pandas Bootcamp: Healthcare Data Analysis 🩺📊

A structured, beginner-friendly project to learn **Python and Pandas** through real healthcare data.  
This repo includes a Jupyter Notebook with **20 exercises** covering data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Hands-on **Jupyter Notebook** with exercises.  
- Covers **data cleaning, grouping, pivot tables, visualizations, and correlations**.  
- Realistic **healthcare dataset** for portfolio-ready practice.  
- Clear structure: **Exercise → Purpose → Concepts → Code → Expected Output → Business Insight**.  

---

## 📘 Exercises Overview

The notebook includes 20 exercises, grouped into levels:
- **Basic (1–5)** → Load data, inspect, filter, sort, check missing values.
- **Intermediate (6–10)** → Fill missing values, remove duplicates, group data, create new columns, handle datetimes.
- **Advanced (11–15)** → Top 5 analysis, pivot tables, correlation matrix, bar charts, monthly trends.
- **Visualization** (16–20) → Histograms, box plots, pie charts, line plots, heatmaps.

Each exercise concludes with **business insights** — showing not just how to analyze data, but why it matters.


## 🔮 Future Work
- Add more and diverse datasets.  
- Introduce **Seaborn** and **Plotly** for richer visualizations.  
- Extend exercises to cover **Machine learning basics** with Scikit-learn.  
- Automate reports (PDF/HTML) for insights presentation.
